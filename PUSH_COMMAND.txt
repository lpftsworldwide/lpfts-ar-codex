🚀 MANUAL PUSH TO GITHUB REQUIRED

Run this command:

cd /home/artemis/Workspace/LPFTS/ar-vr
git push origin main --force

When prompted:
- Username: lpftsworldwide (or your GitHub username)
- Password: [Use your Personal Access Token]

Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Scopes: repo (full control)
- Expiration: 90 days

Why --force?
The remote has old messy commits from when git was in the wrong directory.
We're replacing them with our clean 3-commit history.

Clean commits being pushed:
1. 101066c - feat(ar): LPFTS Legacy Codex WebAR Experience
2. 12511c3 - fix(csp): remove restrictive CSP headers blocking MindAR  
3. 438de10 - fix(assets): add functional GLB model for AR codex

After pushing, GitHub will show: 72 clean files, no dev docs, no home directory junk!
